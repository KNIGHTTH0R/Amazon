# Amazon

Simple web application that contains a list of products for some web shop. For every product there is a list of reviews and ratings. You can add new reviews and ratings for every product.

To run the application you should adjust database settings in **model/db.class.php** and first run script **app/boot/prepare_DB.php**. That script creates database tables and fills database with few products and reviews. 

Application is written in PHP following MVC design pattern. 

App is in Croatian.
